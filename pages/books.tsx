          I try to read as much as I can. This is a list of the books I've recently read, am currently reading, and am going to read. I read non-fiction almost exclusively but am open to reading just about anything. You can also recommend any books if you'd like, at the bottom of the page. Might add a comments feature if this page gets any engagement, at all.
