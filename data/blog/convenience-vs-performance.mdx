An major issue Christy Vault faced with their last website of over 15 years, was their lack of ability to update content themselves. The site was built during the ancient times of HTML tables and coding in text editors. If something needed to be updated, they had to ask the webmaster.

My goal was to remove the middle man. I wanted to make it as simple and straight-forward as possible for the office manager, or anyone to add a new project page, write out a new blog post or event. Make changes to page content, even.

I first decided to go with Wordpress, paired with Elementor pagebuilder. At my previous job with Designstudio, I had convinced our team to ditch our highly custom, overbloated, theme for our clients and switch to custom re-usable content on Elementor. It ended up saving the company so much time and money, and they could hire people on Fiverr to "drag-n-drop" together client sites in India and have them done for us by the time we were back in the office the next morning. It was so simple and easy to use the Elementor pagebuilder.

However, I noticed how bloated Elementor was. The way Elementor encapsulates their code, creating upwards of 100+ requests per page load.... to be continued.
