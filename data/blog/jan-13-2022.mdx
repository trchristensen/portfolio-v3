## First update of my dev log.

Today while browsing reddit I came across a post on r/webdev/ of a guy who publically posted his "dev log". He mentioned his recent work on his project and what he plans on doing next. At first, I scoffed at him and the fact that he was posting his journal on reddit for everyone to see. I mean, who really cares what this guy is up to? I guess me because I read his whole post.. Haha. 

It is funny because it reminded me a lot of myself. I have hundreds of notes on evernote describing my newest ideas for apps, what I'm going to do next, yada yada yada. I just never thought about posting them publically. I think this is actually a good idea. Maybe people will read them, maybe they won't. What it will do, though, is create new habits.

Posting daily or bi-daily will get you in the habit of posting something. I think it's a good habit to have, not to mention, will keep motivation up, so there is something to write about. Also by posting publically, even if no one is reading it, you will be able to see how you are progressing. And there is a chance that someone will read it and find something interesting. Maybe they will reach out and provide help or advice? Maybe they will want to collaborate on something? Who knows? I don't see any downsides to doing this.

So that's what I'm going to be doing from now on...

## On to the log part...

The past few days have been pretty productive for me. I did quite a bit of work on my "product hunt of crypto" app. From now on I'll call it Crypto Hype (don't have a name yet for it). I added comment functionality and votes on comments. I didn't want to get too recursive with the comments, since product hunt only goes one layer deep as well. 

My goal with this app is to make at least one commit every day. Keep chipping away at it and hopefully have it done by the end of the month. That means, probably by the end of February in dev time.

To break up the monotony, I decided to learn C++ and have been doing a simple codeAcademy course on it since yesterday. It is surprising to me how similar the syntax is to javascript in a lot of ways. I haven't gotten to the memory management part yet though. Anyway, my whole goal with this is to learn a lower level language that I may or may not use, depending on if I decide to dabble with Unreal Engine or not. I've always been intriqued with the idea of making my own worlds and games. It will be more for fun than anything else. So that's all I've got for now. Until next time.. ‚úåüèª
